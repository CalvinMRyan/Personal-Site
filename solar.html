        <h1>Solar Photovoltaic</h1>

        <p> 
        From 2010 to 2014 I designed solar photovoltaic arrays for Ryan Energy Technologies in Union, NJ. The designs below exhibit some of my small-scale residential arrays and large-scale commercial arrays.
        During those four years I gained valuable knowledge of current and emerging photovoltaic technologies as well as key design considerations for solar arrays. I also had the opportunity to install solar arrays that I personally designed.
        This experience allowed me to explore my interests in sustainability, engineering, and design.
